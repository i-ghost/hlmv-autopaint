0005:
	Updated upload.py
	
|	upload.py

0004:
	Adjusted both automation scripts to remove the "ready to do BLU paints" message, was unnecessary.
	Added a python upload script (upload.py) to use with renameImagesWikiNames.bat.
		Included modified wikitools.
	Marked fixVMT.py as obsolete, is quicker and easier in terms of workflow to just add the "$color2" string yourself.
	Marked hlmv-tf2.bat as obsolete, the SDK now uses the correct shaders by default.

0003:
	Adjusted fixVMT.py.  $color2 didn't need a \n prefix, prefixing $colortint_base with \t to keep the VMT's indentation clean.
	Added a slow version of automateCaptureImages.  This one should be slow enough to be used if the images are being taken on-class - for example, Coupe D'isaster.
	
+	automateCaptureImages_slow.ahk

0002:
	Replaced renameImages with two variants, one renaming for easy manual uploading; the other renaming to the Wiki-used names.
